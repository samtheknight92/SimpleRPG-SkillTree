SKILL SYSTEM
------------
Skills are your character's abilities and are organized by:

TIERS (1-5): Higher tiers are more powerful but require lower tiers first
- Tier 1: 5 Lumens - Basic abilities
- Tier 2: 10 Lumens - Intermediate abilities  
- Tier 3: 15 Lumens - Advanced abilities
- Tier 4: 20 Lumens - Expert abilities
- Tier 5: 25 Lumens - Master abilities

CATEGORIES:
‚Ä¢ WEAPONS: Combat skills for different weapon types
‚Ä¢ MAGIC: Spellcasting and magical abilities
‚Ä¢ PROFESSIONS: Crafting, social, and utility skills
‚Ä¢ RACIAL: Unique skills based on your chosen race
‚Ä¢ FUSION: Special combined skills (unlocked through gameplay)

EARNING LUMENS
--------------
You earn Lumens (skill currency) through:
‚Ä¢ Completing quests and objectives
‚Ä¢ Good roleplay and character development
‚Ä¢ Creative problem solving
‚Ä¢ Participating actively in sessions
‚Ä¢ Achieving campaign milestones

üí° TIP: Humans earn 10% more Lumens than other races!

SPECIAL: HUMAN CROSS-CULTURAL LEARNING
---------------------------------------
If you play a Human:
1. First, learn "Human Determination" (your racial Tier 1 skill)
2. This unlocks "Cross-Cultural Learning"
3. You can then purchase Tier 1 skills from ANY other race!
4. These appear with their source race marked (e.g. "Skill Name (üßù Elf)")

This makes humans incredibly versatile but they don't get advanced racial abilities like other races.

EQUIPMENT & INVENTORY

Your character can equip:

CRAFTING SYSTEM
---------------
Create enhanced equipment by:
1. Learning crafting skills (like Smithing, Alchemy)
2. Gathering required materials
3. Using the crafting interface to combine components
4. Creating items better than shop-bought equivalents

Some recipes require rare materials or special locations!

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT TIPS
---------------------------
1. SPECIALIZE: Focus on 2-3 skill categories for effectiveness
2. PREREQUISITES: Plan your skill progression - check what skills require others
3. BALANCE: Don't neglect basic stats in favor of flashy abilities

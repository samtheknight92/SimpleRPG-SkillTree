manage the game world, monsters, and player progression.

GETTING STARTED

   - Item administration
   - Character manipulation tools

CHARACTER CREATION OVERSIGHT

When players create characters, they will:
1. Choose a name and optional folder organization
2. Select a race (each race has unique abilities and skill trees)
3. Allocate starting stats (HP, Stamina, Strength, Magic Power, Accuracy)
4. Start with 50 Lumens (the game's skill currency)

SKILL SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
-----------------------
Skills are organized by:
• TIERS: 1-5 (higher tiers require lower tier prerequisites)
• CATEGORIES: Weapons, Magic, Professions, Racial, Fusion
• COST: Increases with tier (5L for Tier 1, up to 25L for Tier 5)

As GM, you can:
- Award Lumens for quest completion, roleplay, problem-solving
- Grant skills directly in DEV MODE for story reasons
- Create custom fusion skills when players meet specific requirements
- Adjust character stats for balance

• Minor quest completion: 5-10 Lumens
• Major quest milestone: 15-25 Lumens
• Excellent roleplay: 3-5 Lumens
• Creative problem solving: 5-10 Lumens
• Session participation: 2-5 Lumens

Remember: Humans earn 10% more Lumens due to their "Ambitious Spirit" trait

MONSTER SYSTEM
--------------
In DEV MODE, you can:
1. Create monster characters (check "This is a Monster" during creation)
2. Use Monster Presets for quick setup
3. Access Elemental Affinity skills for magical creatures
4. Scale monster HP and abilities to challenge players

Monster Features:
• Elemental Resistances/Weaknesses
• Special monster-only skills
• Simplified stat progression
• Quick preset loading

SHOP & ECONOMY
--------------
The shop system includes:
• Weapons and armor by tier
• Crafting materials
• Consumables (potions, tools)
• Tier-gated equipment (players must unlock access)

As GM you can:
- Control what items are available in shops
- Adjust prices for your campaign economy
- Add custom items through the Item Admin panel
- Grant items directly to characters

CRAFTING OVERSIGHT
------------------
Players can craft:
• Enhanced weapons and armor
• Consumables and tools
• Fusion items (combining multiple components)

Monitor crafting to ensure:
- Players have required skills and materials
- Crafted items don't break game balance
- Resource scarcity maintains challenge

COMBAT CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------
The system tracks:
• HP (Health Points)
• Stamina (for special abilities)
• Status Effects (buffs/debuffs)
• Elemental Resistances

During combat:
- Many skills have Stamina costs (manage resource consumption)
- Status effects can stack and interact
- Elemental damage types matter for resistances
- Some skills are once-per-combat or once-per-day

DEV MODE TOOLS
--------------
• Skip Prerequisites: Allow any skill purchase
• Monster Access: Create and manage monster characters
• Item Admin: Add/modify items and equipment
• Stat Manipulation: Adjust character stats directly
• Race Removal: Remove character race (for testing)
• Unlimited Resources: Bypass resource costs

CAMPAIGN INTEGRATION
--------------------
• NOTES SYSTEM: Encourage players to use the Notes tab for character development
• CHARACTER SHEETS: All stats, skills, and equipment in one place
• INVENTORY TRACKING: Automatic weight and encumbrance calculations
• PROGRESSION TRACKING: Clear skill trees show character growth paths

BALANCE TIPS
------------
1. Don't let players hoard Lumens - encourage spending on character growth
2. Challenge diverse skill builds with varied encounter types
3. Use elemental weaknesses/resistances for tactical depth
4. Fusion skills should require rare materials or special circumstances
5. Monitor cross-cultural learning (humans) to prevent overpowering

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
• If skills aren't appearing: Check prerequisites and character race restrictions
• If shop items are missing: Verify character has unlocked required tiers
• If crafting fails: Check material availability and required skills
• For dev issues: Toggle DEV MODE off and on to refresh

STORY INTEGRATION
-----------------
Use the system's features to enhance narrative:
• Racial skills reflect cultural backgrounds and training
• Fusion skills can represent unique discoveries or training
• Status effects can reflect curses, blessings, or environmental factors
• Equipment tiers can gate access to legendary artifacts

Remember: The system supports your story - don't let mechanics override good 
storytelling and player agency. Use DEV MODE to make adjustments that serve 
the narrative and ensure everyone has fun!

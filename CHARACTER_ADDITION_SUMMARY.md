## Next Steps

1. **Test the Dev Mode Character Selector** to verify the new characters appear correctly

3. **Continue Adding Characters** in batches to reach the full 157 character count
4. **Balance Categories** by adding more characters to underrepresented types

- Level calculations are properly applied
- Character IDs are unique and preserved
- Equipment and skills are validated against existing system data
- Racial abilities and passive traits are properly formatted

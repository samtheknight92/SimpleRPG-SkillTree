## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT WITHOUT CONSENT FROM ME):
- Consider adding more utility items and quest items
- Consider expanding the monster loot system with new items
- Consider adding item enchantment slots

## üö® CRITICAL PLAYTEST FIXES NEEDED:

### 1. ‚úÖ BOW EQUIPPING ERROR FIX - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Bows can be added to inventory but cause errors when equipping
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues with weapon category mapping:
1. Case sensitivity issue in `getWeaponCategory` method - 'bows' mapped to 'Bow' instead of 'bow'
2. Incorrect mapping in `getWeaponCategory` - 'bows' mapped to 'bow' instead of 'ranged'
**Solution**: 
1. Fixed case sensitivity in `inventory-system.js` line 230
2. Updated `getWeaponCategory` to map 'bows' to 'ranged' to match character structure
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Bows should now equip correctly (requires Bow Beginner skill)

### 1.5. ‚úÖ BOW BEGINNER SKILL PURCHASE ERROR - COMPLETED
**Problem**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')" when purchasing "Bow Beginner"
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between skills data structure (uses 'Bow' capitalized) and character structure (uses 'ranged' lowercase)
**Solution**: Added weapon subcategory mapping in `unlockSkill` method to map 'Bow' to 'ranged'
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Bow Beginner skill should now purchase correctly

### 1.6. ‚úÖ PURCHASED SKILLS SHOWING "BUY" BUTTON - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Purchased skills continue to show "BUY" button instead of "Refund" button after using Dev Mode
**Root Cause**: Skill tree rendering was looking for unlocked skills in wrong location (Bow vs ranged subcategory)
**Solution**: Added same weapon subcategory mapping in `renderSkillNode` method
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Purchased skills should now show "Refund" button correctly

### 1.7. ‚úÖ FUSION SKILL PREREQUISITE CHECKING BUG - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Fusion skills show prerequisites as not met even when skills are unlocked (e.g., Flame Arrow showing Quick Draw and Fireball as unmet)
**Root Cause**: Skill tooltip was using its own prerequisite checking logic instead of character manager's consistent logic
**Solution**: Updated skill tooltip to use character manager's `validateSkillPrerequisites` and `isSkillUnlocked` methods
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Prerequisites should now be correctly detected for fusion skills

### 1.8. ‚úÖ FUSION SKILLS TAB NOT APPEARING - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Fusion skills tab/category not appearing even when prerequisites are met
**Root Cause**: `isFusionSkillAvailable` method was looking for `skill.fusionRequirements` instead of `skill.prerequisites`
**Solution**: Fixed `isFusionSkillAvailable` to use correct prerequisite structure and character manager's validation logic
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Fusion skills tab should now appear when prerequisites are met

### 2. ‚úÖ MONSTER LUMEN DROP SYSTEM OVERHAUL - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Dropped Lumen from monsters needs scaling based on player count
**Current**: Fixed amount per monster
**New System**: Percentage of Purchased Lumen based on player count
- 1 player: 10% of Purchased Lumen
- 2-3 players: 15% of Purchased Lumen  
- 4-5 players: 20% of Purchased Lumen
- 6+ players: 25% of Purchased Lumen
**Solution**: Updated `ui-components.js` to calculate player count and apply scaling percentages
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Monster lumen drops now scale with player count

### 3. ‚úÖ FUSION SKILLS NOT APPEARING - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Fusion Skills don't show up even when prerequisites are met
**Root Cause**: Missing fusion skill subcategory initialization in character data structure
**Solution**: 
- Fixed character initialization in `character-manager.js` to ensure all fusion subcategories exist
- Updated UI rendering in `ui-components.js` to properly initialize fusion skill arrays
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Fusion skills should now appear when prerequisites are met
